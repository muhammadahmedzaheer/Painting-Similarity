## Installation  
To set up the project, clone the repository and install dependencies:  

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/muhammadahmedzaheer/HumanAI-Task2.git  
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Execution Steps  

### 1. Download the dataset  
Downloads all painting images from the National Gallery of Art dataset using published_images.csv.  
Script: download_images.py  
Output: A folder images/ containing the downloaded paintings.  

```
python download_images.py
```

### 2. Inspect Downloaded Images (Optional)  
Verifies if the images were downloaded correctly by displaying a few samples.  
Script: inspect_images.py  

```
python inspect_images.py  
```

### 3. Extract Features Using ResNet50  
Extracts deep learning feature embeddings using a pre-trained ResNet50 model.  
Script: extract_features.py  
Outputs:  
- features.npy â†’ Feature vectors for all images.  
- image_names.npy â†’ Corresponding filenames for the extracted features.  

```
python extract_features.py  
```

### 4. Compute Cosine Similarity  
Computes cosine similarity between all paintings based on extracted feature vectors.  
Script: compute_similarity.py  
Output:  
- similarity_scores.npy â†’ A large similarity matrix storing all computed similarity values (not included in GitHub due to size constraints).  

```
python compute_similarity.py  
```

### 5. Extract Top 10 Most Similar Paintings  
Extracts the 10 most similar paintings for each image using cosine similarity.  
Script: extract_top_10.py  
Output:  
- top_10_similar.npy â†’ Stores the filenames and similarity scores of the 10 closest matches.  

```
python extract_top_10.py  
```

### 6. Display Similar Paintings  
Selects a random painting and visualizes its top 10 most similar paintings with similarity scores.  
Script: display_similar.py  
Inputs: top_10_similar.npy, image_names.npy, and the images/ folder.  

```
python display_similar.py  
```

### 7. Model Evaluation (Inter- and Intra-Class Similarity)  
Evaluates the effectiveness of the similarity model.  
Script: evaluate_unsupervised.py  
Evaluation Metrics Used:  
- Intra-Class Similarity â†’ The average similarity between an image and its top 10 matches (expected to be high).  
- Inter-Class Similarity â†’ The average similarity between an image and randomly selected paintings (expected to be low).  

```
python evaluate_unsupervised.py  
```

## Alternative Approach: Direct Computation of Top 10 Similar Images  
Computes and stores only the top 10 most similar paintings per image, eliminating the need for a full similarity matrix.  
Script: optimized_similarity.py  
Output: top_10_similar.npy  

```
python optimized_similarity.py  
```

#### Note: While this approach reduces storage, it affects evaluation. Without similarity_scores.npy, the model lacks references for non-similar paintings, leading to an overestimation of inter-class similarity.  

Example:  
- Using full similarity matrix â†’ Intra = 0.88, Inter = 0.58 (Clear distinction between similar and dissimilar images)  
- Using only top 10 matches â†’ Intra = 0.88, Inter = 0.86 (Poor distinction, as random images appear more similar than they actually are)  

## Evaluation Metrics  

Evaluation of the model is based on three key metrics: **Cosine Similarity, Intra-Class Similarity, and Inter-Class Similarity**.  

### **1. Cosine Similarity**  
- **Displayed by:** `display_similar.py`  
- **Purpose:** Measures the **pairwise similarity** between two paintings based on their extracted feature vectors.  
- **How it works:** When `display_similar.py` is run, it randomly selects a painting and shows its **top 10 most similar images**, along with their **cosine similarity scores**. Higher scores indicate greater similarity.  

### **2. Intra-Class Similarity**  
- **Displayed by:** `evaluate_unsupervised.py`  
- **Purpose:** Measures how **visually similar** the **top 10 retrieved images** are to a given painting.  
- **How it works:** The average cosine similarity is calculated between an image and its **top 10 similar matches** (as stored in `top_10_similar.npy`). A **high intra-class similarity** suggests that the model correctly groups paintings that are truly alike.  

### **3. Inter-Class Similarity**  
- **Displayed by:** `evaluate_unsupervised.py`  
- **Purpose:** Measures how **dissimilar** a painting is to randomly selected paintings.  
- **How it works:** The model selects **10 random paintings** and calculates their average similarity to the given painting. A **low inter-class similarity** indicates that the model correctly differentiates between similar and non-similar paintings.  

---
Metric                 | Purpose  
---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------  
Cosine Similarity      | Measures pairwise similarity between paintings.  
Intra-Class Similarity | Ensures similar paintings are correctly grouped (high).  
Inter-Class Similarity | Ensures dissimilar paintings are correctly separated (low).  


### **Why Are All Three Metrics Necessary?**  

Each of these three metrics plays a crucial role in evaluating the effectiveness of the model:  

- **Cosine Similarity (display_similar.py)** only shows individual similarity scores between an image and its closest matches. While useful, it does **not** tell us how well the model separates similar and dissimilar paintings overall.  

- **Intra-Class Similarity (evaluate_unsupervised.py)** ensures that paintings retrieved as similar are truly close in feature space. If this score is low, the model **fails to retrieve relevant paintings correctly**.  

- **Inter-Class Similarity (evaluate_unsupervised.py)** ensures that randomly selected, unrelated paintings have **low similarity** to the query painting. If this score is high, it means the model **is not effectively distinguishing between different paintings**.  

The **ideal result** is:  
âœ… **High Intra-Class Similarity** â†’ The model correctly identifies paintings that belong together.  
âœ… **Low Inter-Class Similarity** â†’ The model successfully differentiates between unrelated paintings.  

If **inter-class similarity is too high**, it means the model is not discriminative enough and is incorrectly labeling unrelated paintings as similar.  

By combining these three metrics, we get a complete picture of **both retrieval quality and discrimination ability** of the model. ðŸš€  

#### Notes & Limitations  
- similarity_scores.npy (56GB) is not included in the repository due to storage constraints.  
- features.npy is also omitted but can be recomputed using extract_features.py.  
- The repository provides all necessary scripts for full reproducibility of the similarity model.
